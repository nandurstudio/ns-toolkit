## Overview

NS Toolkit - Mesh Cleanup Pro is a powerful, **completely free** Blender add-on that combines topology visualization with automated mesh cleanup operations. Perfect for game developers, 3D artists, architects, and anyone working with imported or messy geometry.

**Professional mesh optimization with real-time topology visualization and smart cleanup tools**

---

## Features

### **Topology Visualization**
- **Highlight Triangles Toggle** - Visual identification of mesh topology
- **Color-Coded Display**: Red=Triangles, Green=Quads, Blue=N-gons
- **Real-Time Preview** - See topology before cleanup operations
- **Easy Toggle** - One-click enable/disable highlighting

### **Professional Mesh Cleanup Toolkit**
1. **Real-Time Topology Highlighting** - Live visualization in both Edit and Object modes
2. **Converts Triangles to Quads** - Smart topology optimization for better mesh flow  
3. **Merges Vertices by Distance** - Removes duplicate vertices with configurable threshold
4. **Recalculates Normals Outside** - Fixes inverted faces for proper lighting
5. **Resets Custom Normal Vectors** - Clears custom normals for clean calculations

### 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface**
- **Sidebar Integration**: Access via N-Panel under "NS Toolkit" tab
- **Topology Visualization**: Toggle highlighting with real-time color feedback
- **Clean Mesh Action**: Renamed from "Mesh Cleanup Pro" for better clarity
- **Menu Integration**: Available in Object > Convert menu  
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Quick access with `Ctrl + Alt + J`
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple objects simultaneously

### ⚙️ **Customizable Settings**
- **Adjustable Merge Distance**: Fine-tune vertex merging (0.0001 - 1.0)
- **Real-time Feedback**: Success notifications with object count
- **Full Undo Support**: Integrated with Blender's undo system

---

## 📋 System Requirements

- **Blender**: 4.2.0 or higher (tested up to 4.5+)
- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Performance**: Optimized for large meshes

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. Download the extension from Blender Extensions platform
2. In Blender: `Edit > Preferences > Get Extensions`
3. Search for "NS Toolkit" and install
4. The tool appears in N-Panel under "NS Toolkit" tab

---

## 🎮 Usage

### Quick Workflow:
1. Select mesh object(s) in your scene
2. Open sidebar (N-key) → "NS Toolkit" tab
3. **Optional**: Toggle "Highlight All Objects" to visualize topology across scene
   - 🔵 Blue = Has N-gons, 🔴 Red = Triangle-dominant, 🟢 Green = Quad-dominant
4. Adjust merge distance if needed (default: 0.0001)
5. Click "Clean Mesh" button
6. Done! All cleanup operations complete automatically

### Keyboard Shortcut:
Press `Ctrl + Alt + J` for instant access to the cleanup tool

### Real-Time Topology Visualization:
- **Scene-Wide**: Highlights ALL objects in scene, not just selected
- **Live Updates**: Real-time color changes in both Object and Edit modes  
- **Smart Colors**: 🔵 Blue=Has N-gons (priority), 🔴 Red=Triangle-dominant, 🟢 Green=Quad-dominant
- **Edit Mode**: Instant feedback as you modify mesh topology
- **Performance**: Optimized handlers with automatic cleanup

---

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Game Development**: Clean CAD imports for game engines
- **Architecture**: Process BIM models for visualization  
- **3D Printing**: Ensure manifold geometry before slicing
- **Animation**: Prepare meshes for subdivision and rigging
- **General 3D Work**: Any project needing mesh cleanup

---

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Merge Distance Guidelines:
- **High Detail Objects**: 0.0001 - 0.001
- **Medium Objects**: 0.001 - 0.01  
- **Large/Rough Meshes**: 0.01 - 0.1

### Operations Performed:
1. `mesh.tris_convert_to_quads()` - Triangle to quad conversion
2. `mesh.remove_doubles(threshold=X)` - Vertex merging
3. `mesh.normals_make_consistent(inside=False)` - Normal correction
4. `mesh.customdata_custom_splitnormals_clear()` - Normal vector reset

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Q: Tool doesn't appear after installation**  
A: Make sure you're in Object Mode and have mesh objects selected

**Q: Some triangles remain after conversion**  
A: Normal behavior - conversion only happens where topology allows

**Q: Merge distance seems aggressive**  
A: Try smaller values like 0.0001 for detailed meshes

**Q: Getting errors during operation**  
A: Ensure you have mesh objects selected and you're in Object Mode
