## ✨ Core Features (Initial Release)

### 👁️ Real-Time Topology Visualization
- **Scene-Wide Analysis** - Simultaneously highlights ALL mesh objects in scene
- **Smart Color Priority System**:
  - 🔵 **Blue** = Has N-gons (priority highlighting for critical topology)
  - 🔴 **Red** = Triangle-dominant meshes
  - 🟢 **Green** = Quad-dominant meshes (optimal topology)
- **Live Edit Mode Updates** - Instant color changes as you modify mesh topology
- **Real-Time Feedback** - See changes immediately without leaving Edit mode
- **Performance Optimized** - Dual handler system with automatic cleanup

### 🔧 Professional 5-in-1 Mesh Cleanup
1. **Real-Time Topology Highlighting** - Advanced visualization system
2. **Triangles to Quads Conversion** - Smart algorithm for optimal quad topology
3. **Merge Vertices by Distance** - Configurable precision (0.0001-1.0) for duplicate removal
4. **Recalculate Normals Outside** - Consistent lighting with proper face orientation
5. **Reset Custom Normal Vectors** - Clean slate for proper normal calculations

### 🎨 Professional User Interface
- **Dynamic Version Display** - Shows current addon version automatically
- **Branded Experience** - Professional NS Toolkit styling with logo
- **Smart Layout** - Separate sections for visualization and cleanup operations
- **Live Color Legend** - Visual guide displayed when highlighting is active
- **Comprehensive Feedback** - Detailed success/error reporting with object counts
